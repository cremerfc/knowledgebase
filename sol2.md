<h1> Solution for Replicated Quest for the Ring </h1>

If you have landed here, you probably have run into this issue:

<p align="center"><img src="tile.png" width=450 ></img></p>

This error is caused when the app does not find a specific file with the proper permissions on startup. The application is looking for a file called `config.txt` located in `/etc/ring-game/` which is a [hostPath](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath) Volume attached to the Pod. The file must have `400` permissions.

To solve the issue, create the file and assign `400` permissions.

<details>
  <summary>Open for a hint on how to create the file and assign permissions</summary>

To create the file with the proper permissions run the following command on the terminal:

```shell
$ sudo touch /etc/ring-game/config.txt
$ sudo chmod 400 /etc/ring-game/config.txt
```

</details>

The Pod may need to be restarted, in that case, get the list of pods and delete the offending pod. Its ```Deployment``` should schedule a new one right away.

To get the list of pods, run the following command:

```shell
$ kubectl get pods
```

You should see an output similar to this:

```shell

NAME                                  READY   STATUS                  RESTARTS   AGE

kotsadm-7d68c66d9-wbx5t               1/1     Running                 0          87m
kotsadm-postgres-0                    1/1     Running                 0          87m

```

The offending pod is the one in the `Init:CrashLoopBackOff` STATUS. To delete the pod, run the following command:

```shell

$ kubectl delete pod kubecon-game-77b49b445-mwfvn

```
</details>

Once the new pod is up and running, go back to the Admin Console to check that the app is now up and running.

Select the `Application` tab to view the Application's Status. Refresh the browser if needed.

If refreshing the page yields a `404` or similar error (page not found), this could mean more issues. But since we can't access the UI, how can we generate a support bundle?

Thankfully, [Troubleshoot](https://troubleshoot.sh) provides both a `pre-flight` and `support-bundle` plugins for `kubectl`. To collect a Support Bundle from the command line, we will use the `support-bundle` plugin, which is already installed on this Cluster (Clusters installed by kURL by default have these plugins installed).

All we need to do is provide it a `Support Bundle` spec to tell it which `collectors` and `analyzers` to run.

Open you favorite Linux editor and create a `support-bundle.yaml` file with the following contents:

<details>

```yaml

apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2

In the spec above, we have five `collectors` defined. Two capture cluster information, one collects logs from any pod that has the label `app=kubecon-game` and two that `exec` into the first pod it finds with the label `app=file-check-pod` to check for files with specific permissions. We also have three `analyzers` and the results of these will be displayed to the end user. All of the `analyzers` in this spec are using `RegEx` on the output of the `collectors` to determine a pass/fail scenario.

Once the file is created, run the following command from the same terminal:

```shell

$ kubectl support-bundle support-bundle.yaml

```

Once you run the support bundle command, you should see this:

<p align="center"><img src="sboutput1.png" width=450 ></img></p>

As you can see you can scroll down to see the other two results:

<p align="center"><img src="sboutput2.png" width=450 ></img></p>
<p align="center"><img src="sboutput3.png" width=450 ></img></p>

As we can see from the results, there are two issues that we need to address:

* The file `restraining-bolt.txt` is missing from `/etc/ring-game` directory
* The `kotsadm` service is missing

To solve the issue, we repeat the same steps as before. Don't forget to ensure the file also has permissions set to `400`.

<details>
  <summary>Open for a hint on how to create the file and assign permissions</summary>

To create the file with the proper permissions run the following command on the terminal:

```shell
$ sudo touch /etc/ring-game/restraining-bolt.txt
$ sudo chmod 400 /etc/ring-game/restraining-bolt.txt
```

</details>


To solve the second issue, we need to create the service. The service must meet the following criteria:

* **name:** kotsadm
* **type:** ClusterIP
* **selector:** app: kotsadm
* **port:** 3000
* **targetPort:** http


<details>
  <summary>Hint: Open to see the Service Definition Manifest</summary>

Create a file called `kotsadm.yaml` in your local directory. For example:
  
```shell
 $ vi kotsadm.yaml
```
 
Once in the file, paste the following content
   
```yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    kots.io/backup: velero
    kots.io/kotsadm: "true"
  name: kotsadm
  namespace: default
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 3000
    targetPort: http
  selector:
    app: kotsadm
  type: ClusterIP
status:
  loadBalancer: {}

```
  
  Save the file, and run the following command to create the service:
  
```shell
$ kubectl apply -f kotsadm.yaml
```
    
  
</details>

Once you have created the service, refresh the browser a few more times and the Admin Console should come back up. 

Lastly, the app itself may take a while to try again so you should probably delete the `kubecon-game-*` pod so a new one is scheduled.

<details>
  <summary>Open for a hint on how to schedule a new Pod</summary>

To get the list of pods, run the following command:

```shell
$ kubectl get pods
```

You should see an output similar to this:

```shell

NAME                                  READY   STATUS                  RESTARTS   AGE
file-check-pod-76c6bc76d-7xk2d        1/1     Running                 0          9m57s
kotsadm-7d68c66d9-wbx5t               1/1     Running                 0          87m
kotsadm-postgres-0                    1/1     Running                 0          87m
kubecon-game-77b49b445-mwfvn          0/1     Init:CrashLoopBackOff   6          9m57s
kurl-proxy-kotsadm-75cf6dcf54-m74vm   1/1     Running                 0          87m


```

The offending pod is the one in the `Init:CrashLoopBackOff` STATUS. To delete the pod, run the following command:

```shell

$ kubectl delete pod kubecon-game-77b49b445-mwfvn

```
</details>

At this point the App Status should show `Ready`. Click on the `Complete the Quest` button to complete the quest!
